# **Ruby on Rails Simple Navigation Demo**

This repository demonstrates a simple navigation system between two pages in a Ruby on Rails application. If you're new to Rails or want a basic example of routing, controllers, and views in action, this demo is for you.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Ruby**: You can download and install Ruby from the **[official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)**. To check your Ruby version:

   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```

2. **Rails**: Once Ruby is installed, you can install Rails using the gem command:

   ```bash
   gem install rails
   ```

3. **Bundler**: Bundler manages an application's dependencies. Install it using:

   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```

## **Setup & Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhhtaylor/ruby-on-rails.git
   cd ruby-on-rails
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

Visit **`localhost:4000`** in your browser to explore the application.

## **Usage**

The application showcases basic navigation in Rails:

- Open the home page (**`localhost:4000`**).
- Click the "Go to Other Page" link.
- On the other page, click the "Go Back to Home Page" link to return to the home page.
